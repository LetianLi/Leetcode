# Leetcode

This project uses Bun and hosts my solutions to Leetcode problems.

To install Bun see the [Bun Docs](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run the most recent solution:

```bash
bun start
```

To run a specific solution:

```bash

```

```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.21. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
